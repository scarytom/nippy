# Nippy

### The fastest serialization library for Clojure

Clojure's rich data types are awesome. And its [reader](https://clojure.org/reference/reader) allows you to take your data just about anywhere. But the reader can be painfully slow when you've got a lot of data to crunch (like when you're serializing to a database).

Nippy is a mature, high-performance **drop-in alternative to the reader**.

It is used at scale by [Carmine](https://www.taoensso.com/carmine), [Faraday](https://www.taoensso.com/faraday), [PigPen](https://github.com/Netflix/PigPen), [Onyx](https://github.com/onyx-platform/onyx), [XTDB](https://github.com/xtdb/xtdb), [Datalevin](https://github.com/juji-io/datalevin), and others.

## Latest release/s

- `2024-05-26` `v3.4.2`: [release info](../../releases/tag/v3.4.2)

See [here][GitHub releases] for earlier releases.

## Why Nippy?

- Small, simple **all-Clojure** library
- **Terrific performance**: the [best](#performance) for Clojure that I'm aware of
- Comprehensive support for [all standard data types](../../wiki/1-Getting-started#deserializing)
- Easily extendable to [custom data types](../../wiki/1-Getting-started#custom-types)
- **Robust test suite**, incl. full coverage for every supported type
- Auto fallback to [Java Serializable](https://taoensso.github.io/nippy/taoensso.nippy.html#var-*freeze-serializable-allowlist*) when available
- Auto fallback to Clojure Reader for all other types (including tagged literals)
- Pluggable **compression** with built-in [LZ4](https://code.google.com/p/lz4/), [Zstandard](https://facebook.github.io/zstd/), etc.
- Pluggable [encryption](../../wiki/1-Getting-started#encryption) with built-in AES128
- [Tools](https://taoensso.github.io/nippy/taoensso.nippy.tools.html) for easy + robust **integration into 3rd-party libraries**, etc.
- Powerful [thaw transducer](https://taoensso.github.io/nippy/taoensso.nippy.html#var-*thaw-xform*) for flexible data inspection and transformation

## Operational considerations

### Data longevity

Nippy is widely used to store **long-lived** data and promises (as always) that **data serialized today should be readable by all future versions of Nippy**.

But please note that the **converse is not generally true**:

- Nippy `vX` **should** be able to read all data from Nippy `vY<=X` (backwards compatibility)
- Nippy `vX` **may/not** be able to read all data from Nippy `vY>X` (forwards compatibility)

### Rolling updates and rollback

From time to time, Nippy may introduce:

- Support for serializing **new types**
- Optimizations to the serialization of **pre-existing types**

To help ease **rolling updates** and to better support **rollback**, Nippy (since version v3.4) will always introduce such changes over **two version releases**:

- Release 1: to add **read support** for the new types
- Release 2: to add **write support** for the new types

Starting from v3.4, Nippy's release notes will **always clearly indicate** if a particular update sequence is recommended.

### Stability of byte output

It has **never been an objective** of Nippy to offer **predictable byte output**, and I'd generally **recommend against** depending on specific byte output.

However, I know that a small minority of users *do* have specialized needs in this area.

So starting with Nippy v3.4, Nippy's release notes will **always clearly indicate** if any changes to byte output are expected.

## Performance

Since its earliest versions, Nippy has consistently been the **fastest serialization library for Clojure** that I'm aware of. Latest [benchmark](../../blob/master/test/taoensso/nippy_benchmarks.clj) results:

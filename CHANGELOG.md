# `v3.4.2` (2024-05-26)

> **Dep**: Nippy is [on Clojars](https://clojars.org/com.taoensso/nippy/versions/3.4.2).  
> **Versioning**: Nippy uses [Break Versioning](https://www.taoensso.com/break-versioning).

This release includes **important updates to internal dependencies** and is **recommended for all existing users**.

It should be a **straight-forward and non-breaking update** for almost everyone:

| Updating from Nippy version | API changes? | Changes to [byte output](https://github.com/taoensso/nippy/wiki/2-Operational-considerations#stability-of-byte-output)? | New types                                       |

If updating from older versions of Nippy, please see the relevant release notes.

As always:

- See [operational considerations](https://github.com/taoensso/nippy/wiki/2-Operational-considerations) for info on: **data compatibility**, **rolling updates**, **rollback support**, etc.
- It's always a good idea to **ensure adequate testing** in your environment before updating against production data!
- **Please report any unexpected problems** 🙏

# `v3.4.1` (2024-05-02)

> **Dep**: Nippy is [on Clojars](https://clojars.org/com.taoensso/nippy/versions/3.4.1).  
> **Versioning**: Nippy uses [Break Versioning](https://www.taoensso.com/break-versioning).

Like [`v3.4.0`](https://github.com/taoensso/nippy/releases/tag/v3.4.0) but introduces an internal mechanism to help make it easier for some users that do **rolling updates** from earlier versions of Nippy.

Still, the usual warning applies: data **frozen by Nippy version X** should ideally be **thawed by version >= X**, otherwise you run the risk of the thaw throwing when unfamiliar types are encountered. Please note that this can affect **rolling updates**, and can limit your ability to **revert a Nippy update**. Please ensure adequate testing in your environment before updating against production data!

\- [Peter Taoussanis](https://www.taoensso.com)

## Changes since `v3.4.0`

* [mod]  Due to some internal format changes, Nippy `v3.4.1` may produce **different serialized output** to `v3.4.0` and earlier versions of Nippy. Most users won't care about this, but you could be affected if you depend on specific serialized byte values (for example by comparing serialized output between different versions of Nippy).

# `v3.4.0` (2024-04-30)

> **Versioning**: Nippy uses [Break Versioning](https://www.taoensso.com/break-versioning).

This is a non-breaking **feature and maintenance** release and should be a safe update for existing users. But as always, please **test carefully and report any unexpected problems**, thank you! 🙏

**IMPORTANT**: data **frozen by Nippy version X** should always be **thawed by version >= X**, otherwise you run the risk of the thaw throwing when encountering unfamiliar types. Please note that this can affect **rolling updates**, and can limit your ability to **revert a Nippy update**. Please ensure adequate testing in your environment before updating against production data.

> See [here](https://github.com/taoensso/encore#recommended-steps-after-any-significant-dependency-update) for recommended steps when updating any Clojure/Script dependencies.

Note that there's **separate details** below for upgrading from `v2.15` vs `v2.14`:

## Upgrading from `v2.15` (usually non-breaking)

Usually a non-breaking drop-in replacement, but there's some changes you might like to take advantage of. See [#130] for **detailed upgrade instructions**.

### Changes

  - **[BREAKING]** Bumped minimum Clojure version from `v1.5` to `v1.7`.
  - **[BREAKING]** `:nippy/unthawable` responses now have a standardized form: `{:nippy/unthawable {:type _ :cause _ ...}`. Most folks won't care about this change unless they have code specifically to deal with `:nippy/unthawable` responses.
  - [Deprecated] `*serializable-whitelist*` has been split into two separate vars: `*freeze-serializable-allowlist*`, `*thaw-serializable-allowlist`*. See [#130] for details.
  - By default, `freeze` now **allows** the use of Java's Serializable for **any** class. `thaw` continues to be restrictive by default, and will quarantine any objects not on the class allowlist. See [#130] for details.

### New

  - [#122] Option to disable freezing and/or thawing of metadata.
  - `freeze` and `thaw` now support opts: `:serializable-allowlist`, `:incl-metadata?`.
  - New `read-quarantined-serializable-object-unsafe!` util to read quarantined Serializable objects. See [API docs](http://taoensso.github.io/nippy/taoensso.nippy.html#var-read-quarantined-serializable-object-unsafe.21) and/or [#130] for details.
  - Add `allow-and-record-any-serializable-class-unsafe` util. See [API docs](http://taoensso.github.io/nippy/taoensso.nippy.html#var-allow-and-record-any-serializable-class-unsafe) and/or [#130] for details.


## Upgrading from `v2.14` (may be BREAKING)

Likely breaking. Please see [#130] for **detailed upgrade instructions**.

### Changes

  - **[BREAKING]** Bumped minimum Clojure version from `v1.5` to `v1.7`.
  - **[BREAKING]** [#130] `thaw` will now quarantine Serializable objects whose class is not allowed by `*thaw-serializable-allowlist*`. See [#130] for details.
  - **[BREAKING]** `:nippy/unthawable` responses now have a standardized form: `{:nippy/unthawable {:type _ :cause _ ...}`. Most folks won't care about this change unless you have code specifically to deal with `:nippy/unthawable` responses.
  - [#101] Switch default encryptor from `AES-CBC` to `AES-GCM` (faster, includes integrity check)

### New

  - [#127] Add utils: `freeze-to-string`, `thaw-from-string` (@piotr-yuxuan)
  - [#113 #114] Add support for object arrays (@isaksky)
  - [#83 #112] Add support for deftype (@isaksky)
  - [#83 #113] Add support for URIs (@isaksky)
  - [#126] `extend-freeze`: include id collision odds in docstring

### Fixes

  - [#120] Update `freezable?` to cover `nil`
